Now, using Bayes’s Theorem, we can calculate the probability that it rained, knowing there is traffic.\n",

In other words, seeing traffic gives us some evidence that it might have rained, but it’s still less than a 50-50 chance because traffic can happen even without rain."

Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test.\n",
