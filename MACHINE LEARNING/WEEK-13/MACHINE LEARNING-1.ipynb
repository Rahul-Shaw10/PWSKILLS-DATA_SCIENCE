    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by leveraging techniques like clustering or dimensionality reduction. In anomaly detection, the goal is to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm or expected patterns. Unsupervised learning algorithms can help in this process by finding underlying structures or patterns in the data without the need for labeled examples. These algorithms can detect anomalies by identifying data points that do not conform to the learned patterns or clusters. By analyzing the distribution and relationships within the data, unsupervised learning can help identify anomalies and flag them for further investigations."
