        "#####[Ans]\n",
        "The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to predict continuous output (regression). It averages the predictions from individual trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n",

        "###[Q2.] How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
        "#####[Ans]\n",
        "- Bootstrapping: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, reducing overfitting to specific samples.\n",
        "- Feature Subset Selection: At each split, a random subset of features is considered, introducing diversity among the trees.\n",
        "- Aggregation: Predictions are averaged across all trees, smoothing out individual tree biases and variances.\n",
