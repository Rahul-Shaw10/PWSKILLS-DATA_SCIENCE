        "**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** is a statistical model for time series forecasting that combines:\n",
        "1. **AR (AutoRegressive)**: Models the relationship with previous time points.\n",

        "- **ACF**: Shows correlation of a time series with its lagged values. Used to determine the order of the **MA** component.\n",
        "- **PACF**: Shows correlation of a time series with its lagged values, removing influence of intermediate lags. Used to determine the order of the **AR** component.\n",

        "#####[Ans]\n",
        "A **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** model is recommended because:\n",
        "1. The data likely exhibits **seasonality** (monthly trends).\n",
